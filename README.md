# IBM Coursera Capstone Projects 
This notebook is related to the Coursera Capstone Projects, it contain an analysis of Toronto city. The **K - Means Algorithm** is used for segmentation and clustering. **Geocoder** is used to define and get coordinates. **Folium** to project the results in a map visualization. The analysis gives a complete overview on the geograpic distrubution of neigborhoods in Toronto segmentated by geo coordinates. 

The Project has the following parts:

### Part 1
A. *Use webscraping to obtain Post codes of each city in Toronto.*

B. *Cleaning and Preparing the dataset.*
### Part 2
C. *Acquire geo coordinates, longitude and latitude of each neigborhood in Toronto.* 
### Part 3
D. *Execute K- Means Algorithm for segmenting and clustering.*

E. *Use a map to visualize colorized clusters of neigborhoods in Toronto.*
